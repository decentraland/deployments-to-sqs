# Deployments to SQS

This service continuously monitor for deployments that have been made on any Foundation Catalyst.

The service checks for new deployments by sending GET requests to the specified API endpoint [/content/pointer-changes](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getPointerChanges). This continuous monitoring ensures prompt identification of any deployment changes.

When a new deployment delta is detected, the service publishes its data to the configured Amazon SNS topic (`deployments-sns-${env}`). Therefore, any stakeholder that need to react over these deployments can subscribe to this topic and start receiving notifications about new deployments.
